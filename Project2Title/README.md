# Portfolio Template
This repository aims to help those wanting to develop their GitHub repository as a portfolio showcasing a major project. This README explains how to write a markdown file and what should go into a repository. To use this template, first clone this repository and edit this README by filling out the sections below. Next, take the source code of your project and add it to the "source" directory. Note: there should only be one project per repository. After adding the source code, add examples to the "examples" folder. An example could be screenshots of the project in action or could be individual files that show how the project could be used in code. In general, code examples are preferred, but screenshots are useful as they can be added to this README using the following https://www.markdowntutorial.com/lesson/4/. Once you have the source, examples, and README updated, delete this section. In your own Github account, create a new repository and clone to your loacal machine. Next, move the files from this template into your newly clone repository. Run the following commands:
1. git add .
2. git commit -am "initial commit"
3. git push

Congrats! Your project is now in your github account and ready for the world to see. As you create new projects, consider the following guidelines:
* Only code related projects should be stored in GitHub. Github is not a file share and should not include writing assignments. Writing assignments can be displayed as posts on your LinkedIn if you would like to share that with the world.
* Keep repos limited to one project per repo. You may want to expand on it in the future or convert it to a usable library. 
* Always provide examples or a how to use section
* Add professional comments within the code itself
