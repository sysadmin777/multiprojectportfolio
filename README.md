# Portfolio Template
This repository aims to help those wanting to develop their GitHub repository as a portfolio showcasing multiple major projects. This README explains how to write a markdown file and what should go into a repository. To use this template, first clone or download this repository and edit each README in the project subfolders by filling out the sections within each README. Next, take the source code of your project and add it to the "source" directory, which is found in subsequent project folders. **NOTE**: Change the folder names to reflect an appropriate description. After adding the source code, add examples to the "examples" folder. Remove any unused folders or duplicate existing ones to expand your projects. Finally, update the required sections of this README, starting with the "Student Name Portfolio" section.

<br /><br />For the example folders that are in the project subfolders, you could add screenshots of the project in action or individual files that show how the project could be used in code. In general, code examples are preferred, but screenshots are useful as they can be added to README's using the following https://www.markdowntutorial.com/lesson/4/. Once you have the source, examples, and README updated, **delete this section**. In your own Github account, create a new repository and clone to your loacal machine. Next, move the files from this template into your newly clone repository. Run the following commands:
1. git add .
2. git commit -am "initial commit"
3. git push

Congrats! Your project is now in your github account and ready for the world to see. As you create new projects, consider the following guidelines:
* Only code related projects should be stored in GitHub. Github is not a file share and should not include writing assignments. Writing assignments can be displayed as posts on your LinkedIn if you would like to share them with the world.
* Always provide examples or a how to use section
* Add professional comments within the code itself

# Student Name Portfolio
Update the title for this section to be your name and Portfolio. Replace this example text with a one paragraph description of your experience with software engineering (classes you have taken, open-sources projects you have worked on, or personal projects you have taken on). Give a brief description of the programming languages you are familiar with and what languages exist in this repository.
